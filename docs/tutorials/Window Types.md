Content has a window of time that a user can move within when streaming content. 

# Static

For content with a set duration (e.g. VOD/AOD), the window is static and set to the duration of the content.

# Sliding

For live content, the size of the window remains static, however the window slides along time. This means a user can move only a set amount of time forwards and backwards.

# Growing

For content with a start time, but an indeterminate end time, a growing window is used. The window size continues to increase as the content continues to play, allowing a user to move as far back as they want.
