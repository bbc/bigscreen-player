# BigScreen-Player Example App
This project contains a lightweight example of the `bigscreen-player` usage and was developed running in a browser and on TV playback capable devices.

It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://bbc.github.io/bigscreen-player/), and can be controlled on a browser using TAB and RETURN keys.

The example is setup to perform playback via MSE (*Media Source Extensions*), using the DASH dependency. For more info regarding dependencies and development of the player itself, please see the `bigscreen-player` [README](https://github.com/bbc/bigscreen-player/blob/master/README.md), or the official [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/bbc/bigscreen-player/wiki/Architecture-Overview).
